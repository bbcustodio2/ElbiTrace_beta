<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

This application is developed for the purpose of creating a Contact-tracing application using Bluetooth Low-Energy (BLE) Technology and location services. It is 
part of my Special Problem, which is one of my requirements for graduation. This application has 3 main functionalities: 

* User Profile - After a user has registered an account or signed in through their google account, they will be able to see their profile page which includes their COVID-19 Status (which is set to NEGATIVE by default). 
* Virus Heatmap - All COVID-Positive traces will be plotted in Google Maps. no other details will be displayed except where the data was written. 
* Contact Tracing History - all close-proximity contacts will be displayed. This will tell the user if they had been in contact with someone who is COVID-Positive.

This project is still in its early development stage and any suggestions about this application is greatly appreciated!
